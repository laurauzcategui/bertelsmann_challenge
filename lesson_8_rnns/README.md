## Lesson 8 - Recurrent Neural Networks

This lesson was all about Recurrent Neural Networks: 
 - RNN Basics 
 - Architecture of a Recurrent NN  
 - Long Short Term Memory Networks 

Also, you will learn: 
- How to build a Time Series Prediction 
- How to build a sequence generator based on [Anna Karenina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina)


Notebooks: 

- [Create a Simple RNN](#Simple_RNN.ipynb), to perform Time Series Predictions.
- [Create a LSTM](#Character_Level_RNN_Exercise.ipynb), to perform character sequence generation based on the famous novel Anna Karenina.
