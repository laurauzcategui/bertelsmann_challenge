## Lesson 6 - Convolutional Neural Networks 

This lesson was all based on foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks.

Notebooks: 

- [Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST](#mnist_mlp_exercise.ipynb): train an MLP to classify MNIST database. 
- [Train an MLP - MNIST using Validation](#mnist_mlp_solution_with_validation.ipynb), to train the classifier and evaluate the model using validation dataset
- [Custom filters](#custom_filters.ipynb), learn how to create filters for a cnn.
- [Learn how to apply filters to your own CNN](#conv_visualization.ipynb)
- [Train a CIFAR classifier](#cifar10_cnn_exercise.ipynb), using convolutions and max pooling layers into a model
- [Learn about max pooling](#maxpooling_visualization.ipynb), create your own max pooling layers and apply it to your images in your model
